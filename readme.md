5.- when you see the main page of the app, you can click in the login menu to sign in with emmail: user@mail.com and password: password
6.- whe you sign in, you seee a menu with inicio, catalogos, cubo and reportes options
7.- the cubo option, redirect you to a view when you can set/query the cube summation challange


Explination of created classes

1.- For the views, i use the templating engine of laravel Blade, also i use blade layouts for extends layouts for the views. In the views/layouts you can found two layouts for the main page and for the reports views. In the rest of the views i extend from one of these layouts. In the layouts i load bootstrap, jquery, angular.js and anyone tool i need.
2.- In the cubo menu, i redirect to Public/vista.php view. This view contain the logic for the cube summation challage.
i use jquery to manipulate de DOM and validate the form, also i do serialize for the fields of the form and send the data in a POST way.
3.- in the Public/vista.php view, i include a cubo.php file with the class cubo (view layer)
4.- the class cubo, has the inicializar, getcubo, setcubo, updatecubo and query methods. bellow the explination (logic layer)
	inicializar method: initilizes a 3d array to 0
	getcubo method: return the cubo array property of the class
	setcubo method: set the value of a position of the array with x,y,z coords. with a input value (w in the view)
	updatecubo method: update the value of a position of the array with x,y,z coords. with a input value (w in the view)
	query method: performs the summation for the values stored in the 3d array from the x1,y1,z1 coord. to x2,y2,z3 coord.
5.-in the catalogos menu, you can get the view for the users list, where you can edit, delete or add new users for the app. I use a Usuario model extending Eloquent class and declaring primarykey, table name, and setting timestamp to false for not use timestamp in the table of the database. (model layer)
6.- for the users control, i create a usuariosController controller. following the laravel structure, this file is located in app/controllers folder. this class inherit from BaseController class, the parent class of all controllers. this class has mostrarUsuarios, nuevoUsuario,crearUsuario,verUsuario methods.
7,- for the login control, i use de Auth feature of Laravel. In the app.php file of config folder, i override //'Illuminate\Auth\AuthServiceProvider' with "Ollieread\Multiauth\MultiauthServiceProvider" and //'Illuminate\Auth\Reminders\ReminderServiceProvider' with 'Ollieread\Multiauth\Reminders\ReminderServiceProvider' for remember the authentication.


Refactoring Code Challange

in the app/controllers folder has a CuboController.php file, with  two methods post_confirm()_and post_confirm_refactorized(). the second one, with my refactorization.

the file has documentation about how i think shuld be the code of the method of the controller.

in the begin of my method i use private vars, following the good practices for encapsulate the propoerties of the class only to be used for the controller.

	private $pushMessage= 'Tu servicio ha sido confirmado!';
    private $service_id;
    private $driver_id;
    private $id_usuario;
    private $servicio;
    private $driver;

then i use a CRSF validation, for security of data send it throught the form (servicio_id,driver_id,_token)

if (isset($_POST['_token']))
        {

the _token var, shoul be send it from the form like below can see

	<div class="form-group">
        {{Form::input("hidden", "_token", csrf_token())}}
        {{Form::input("submit", null, "Iniciar sesiÃ³n", array("class" => "btn btn-primary"))}}
    </div>
